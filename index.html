        <p class="land-akg" tabindex="7"> We acknowledge we are on the lands of Turtle Island where Indigenous Peoples have lived since time began. These are
        the ancestral lands of the Anishinaabe, Ininew, and Dakota Nations as well as the traditional trade and travel routes
        of the Anishininew, Dene, and Inuit. We also acknowledge we are on Treaty One territory and the homeland of the 
        Red River MÃ©tis. Pembina Trails School Division is committed to working together in partnership with Indigenous 
        communities in a spirit of reconciliation. </p> 
        <p class="land-akg" tabindex="8">The water we drink comes from Shoal Lake 40 First Nation and our hydro is sourced from numerous First Nations
        here in Manitoba. We are thankful for these resources as a community. </p>

            Peoples of Manitoba. They are commited to working with the Indigenous Peoples to understand the past wrongs done to them by Canada.
            Then, they explain that our water that we drink comes from Shol Lake 40 First Nations which is a Indigenous reserve. They express 
            their thanks to the other First Nations Reserves for other things they give us.</p>
